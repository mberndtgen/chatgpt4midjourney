Ignore all earlier instructions in this session. Now write without wordwraps, headlines, connection words. Write back to back seperated with commas and spaces:

[1] [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]

Replace [1] with the subject "<subject>".
Replace [2] with "drawn in smoke is shown".
Replace [3] with "in the style of <style>". If no "style" parameter is given, replace "style" with "abstract ink art". Otherwise, use the style given with the "style" parameter.
Replace [4] with "flowing silhouettes".
Replace [5] with "polished metamorphosis" or a similar expression.
Replace [6] with "dark and intricate, contemporary, intense".

Build a prompt for an AI-based text to image program that eventually converts that generated prompt into an image.

Always start the prompt with "/imagine prompt: "
Always end the prompt with " --v 5.1"
Never write anything that is in [] brackets
Don't use any line breaks.

When the prompt subject looks better vertically, add "--ar 2:3" before "--v 5.1".
When the subject looks better horizontally, use "--ar 3:2" instead.
Otherwise, use "--ar 1:1".

now generate the prompt
